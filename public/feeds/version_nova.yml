notes: Nova 2.4.5 fixes a long-standing issue with Nova where some users would see a cryptic 1364 error (especially when installing and updating). Thanks to Jon Matterson for solving this issue and sending a pull request. We have also patched issues with character bio editing and continued to work on improving the new Email class.
