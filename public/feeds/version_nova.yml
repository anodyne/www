notes: Nova 2.5 provides compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that aims to give users more control over their data. To that end, Nova now allows users to delete their own account and provides clear privacy policies that admins can modify quickly and easily from the Site Messages page. In addition, we've fixed several long-standing bugs, added PHP 7 supprt, and allowed for searching of private messages.
